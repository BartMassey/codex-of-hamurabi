# The Codex Of Hamurabi
Bart Massey

This is work-in-progress for an Inform 7 adventure game
based reasonably closely on the mechanics of the famous
`HAMURABI.BAS` from David Ahl's famous book of games.

Right now, the setting is pretty well elaborated, but the
game itself isn't really much started.

In the `notes/` subdirectory you will find:

* The original Ahl BASIC code for HAMURABI. Also a couple of
  alternate versions.

* Some pseudocode extracted from a perusal of the game.

You may also want to look at my Python 3 port of the game,
