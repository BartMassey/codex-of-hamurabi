# The Codex Of Hamurabi
Bart Massey

**This code has been abandoned for about 6 years as of this
README.** I got sidetracked by other projects. The current
status:

* The setting is pretty well elaborated and ready to go.

* My friendly neighbor Gene Welborn contributed a game
  engine, but it hasn't really been integrated with the
  setting. I'm not sure it's quite how I want to go, but at
  this point I'm not going anywhere soâ€¦

* There is a *ton* of work left to be done.

I thought I'd publish what I had in the hopes that someone
would pick up my vision and complete it. If not, I'm sure
I'll get to it some year.

The basic game idea is to write an Inform 7 game based
reasonably closely on the mechanics of the famous
`HAMURABI.BAS` from David Ahl's book of BASIC
games. Ideally

* The characters of Hamurabi (the player) and the Steward
  would be fleshed out. A small part of this has already
  been done via the setting.

* The Steward would be given interesting interactions.

* The gameplay would be integrated into the world via the
  titular Codex of Hamurabi, a book of tabular data, into
  which the player would instruct the Steward to enter royal
  decrees governing each season of the game.

* The Steward would report the results of each seasons'
  commands appropriately.

* The endgame would have an interesting story.

In the `notes/` subdirectory you will find:

* The original Ahl BASIC code for HAMURABI. Also a couple of
  alternate versions.

* Some pseudocode extracted from a perusal of the game.
